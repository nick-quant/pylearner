###q:
What is a computer bus? Internal bus, external bus?
###a:
A bus is a communication system that transfers data between components inside a computer, or between computers. This expression covers all related hardware components (wire, optical fiber, etc.) 
Internal bus[edit]
The internal bus, also known as internal data bus, memory bus, system bus or Front-Side-Bus, connects all the internal components of a computer, such as CPU and memory, to the motherboard
External bus[edit]
the expansion bus (sometimes called the input/output bus) allows various motherboard components (USB, serial, and parallel ports, cards inserted in PCI connectors, hard drives, CD-ROM and CD-RW drives, etc.) to communicate with one another. However, it is mainly used to add new devices using what are called expansion slots connected to the input/outpur bus.

###q:
What is the width of a bus?
###a:
The term "width" is used to refer to the number of bits that a bus can transmit at once. 
###end

###id:14
###q:
How to calculate the transfer speed of a bus?
###a:
width * frequencey, e.g.:
16 * 133*10^6 = 2128*10^6 bit/s (16 bit bus, 133 Mhz)
###end

###id:15
###q:
Architecture of a bus
###a:
Each bus is generally constituted of 50 to 100 distinct physical lines, divided into three subassemblies:
The address bus (sometimes called the memory bus) transports memory addresses which the processor wants to access in order to read or write data. It is a unidirectional bus.
The data bus transfers instructions coming from or going to the processor. It is a bidirectional bus.
The control bus (or command bus) transports orders and synchonisation signals coming from the control unit and travelling to all other hardware components. It is a bidirectional bus, as it also transmits response signals from the hardware.

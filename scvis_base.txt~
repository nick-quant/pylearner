Radial Basis Functions. Brief Descrition
###a:

###end

###id:20

###a: 
f(x) = sum{i=1, N} (f_i * g(||p_i − x||))
g(r) = 1/r^2 / sum{N}1/d^2

###id:31
###q:
What is a barycentric interpolation for triangle?
###a: 
– Another way to interpolate inside a triangle, which yields the same linear interpolation as before
– Every point x in a triangle can be written as a barycentric combination of the vertices p_i :
x = sum(a_i * p_i) with sum(a_i) = 1 (α_i are barycentric coordinates)
– If α_i are known, then f(x) can be interpolated from values f_i at the vertices via:
f(x) = a_0*f_0 + a_1*f_1 + (1 - a_0 - a_1)f_2
a_0 = A_0 / A (the ratio of the area of the opposite triangle and the whole triangle

What is visualization?
###a: 
The use of computer-supported, interactive, visual
representations of data to amplify cognition
###end

###id:2
###q:
Why visualize?
###a: 
– lets you see things that would rather go unnoticed (data trends, outliers, dependencies, etc.)
– gives answers faster
– lets you interact with your data, study causes and effects, etc.
– helps to deal with increasing size and diversity of data
– produces pretty, informative, & interactive pictures

###q:
Radial Basis Functions. Brief Descrition
###a: 
– Independent of parameter domain dimension
(1D/2D/3D)
– Each (p_i , f_i) influences f(x) based on Euclidean distance ||p_i − x||
– Nearby points have higher influence than far-away points
###end

###id:19
###q:
Radial Basis Formula
###a: 
f(x) = sum{i=1, N} (f_i * g(||p_i − x||))
g(r) decreases quickly with increasing r, for example g(r) = e^(-r^2)
###end

###id:20
###q:
General Radial Basis Formula disadvantage
###a: 
It does not enforce the values at p_i to be f_i. So we need to choose a function g.
###end

###id:21
###q:
What is the function g in Inverse distance weighting
###a: 
g(r) = 1/r^2 / sum{N}1/d^2
Inverse distance divided by sum of inverse distances
###end

###id:22
###q:
Show that using inverse distance weighting we get f(p_i) = f_i
###a: 
f(x) = sum{i=1, N} (f_i * g(||p_i − x||))
g(r) = 1/r^2 / sum{N}1/d^2
if we plug lim then it is true
f(p_i) = lim{x -> p_i} sum{i=1, N} (f_i * g(||p_i − x||))
###end

###id:23
###q:
Radial basis function approach with coefficients
###a: 
f(x) = sum{i=1, N} (w_i * g(||p_i − x||))
We get a linear system
sum{i=1, N} (w_i * g(||p_i − p_j||)) = f_j
Matrix is N*N (N is number of points)
###end

###id:24
###q:
Drawbacks of radial basis functions
###a: 
– Every sample point has influence on whole domain
– Computationally expensive (solving a system of linear equations)
– Adding a new sample requires re-solving the system
###end

###id:25
###q:
What is the approach with interpolation once triangulation is given?
###a:

– I.e., piecewise linear interpolation of values at interior points
###end

###id:26
###q:
What are the traits of an "optimal" triangulation?
###a: 
– Makes triangles as “round” as possible
– Maximizes the minimum angle in the triangulation radius of in−circle
– Maximizes radius of in-circle / radius of circumcircle
###end

###id:27
###q:
What is a Delauny triangulation?
###a: 
– The circumcircle of any triangle does not contain another point of the set
	• Maximizes the minimum angle in the triangulation
	• Such a triangulation is unique (independent of the order of samples) for all but trivial cases
###end

###id:28
###q:

###q:
Data interpolation inside a triangle. What do we want to achieve?
###a: 
– The triangle lives in a 2 dim plane plane; it has 2 + 1 points (x_i, y_i) with values f_i
- Can we find a function f that interpolates f_i at the points p_i , i.e., f(p_i) = f_i
###end


###id:30
###q:
Data interpolation inside a triangle. How to build it?
###a: 
f(x) = a + bx + cy
1	x_0	   y_o			a			f_0
1	x_1	   y_1			b			f_1
1	x_2	   y_2			c			f_2
###end

###id:29
###q:
What is a barycentric interpolation
###a: 
– Another way to interpolate inside a triangle, which yields the same linear interpolation as before
– Every point x in a triangle can be written as a barycentric combination of the vertices p_i :
x = sum(a_i * p_i) with sum(a_i) = 1 (α_i are barycentric coordinates)
– If α_i are known, then f(x) can be interpolated from values f_i at the vertices via:
f(x) = a_0*f_0 + a_1*f_1 + (1 - a_0 - a_1)f_2
